# Todo list with React Hooks and Context

[Hosted version](https://urban-todolist-react-hooks.netlify.com/)

Coded with:
- JavaScript
- React
- React Hooks
- React Context

Yes, you are right, this is an overkill for a simple todo app. But hey, it was a good practice! =)

The app let's the user add a todo, delete a todo and toggle complete.
